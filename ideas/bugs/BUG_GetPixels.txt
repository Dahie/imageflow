When a workflow contains several (more than one) GetPixel-Units 
(and also Print-Units to display the values), 
the pixel-values will not be correct in any case. 
Especially when image conversion units (Green from RGB, 8bit, ...) 
are applied to the workflow, some Print-Units will display 
the values of other GetPixel-Units.

The generated Macro-Code seems to be correct, 
the reason for this behaviour is not known. 
It could be, that the image conversion affects more than one image 
or the GetPixel-Unit access the wrong image (wrong ID, temporary ID, ...).
