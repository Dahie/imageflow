Grouping groups

In theory grouping groups works. However there are a few drawbacks, why this is currently deactivated.
Grouping a group work is fine in theory. You can do it and the resulting graph is valid and can be executed. 
A group can successfully be ungrouped. So far so good. 

You can save grouped groups. The problem is when you try to read grouped groups.
The reading process is not very straight forward. 
In theory you read the XML. 
You try to create all units, they are identified by an id.
You create the connections between the units by connecting ids.
This works fine on a usual workflow and with some effort it works with groups. 
The effort is, that you can't create the group in one go. You have to create an empty group. 
Read different kinds of connections from the XML (internal connections, external connections and original connections). 
These connections can only be created after all units are read, so they are temporarily saved and processed later.
I don't want to describe the whole process here, the point is, you build the group step by step and you don't have
access to everything at every point. You can't create a connection when the unit's Pin's haven't been created yet, for example.

This is where grouping groups gets ugly. To reconstruct the connections, your grouped group has to know what pins it has.
It can't know this at this point, this the included unit aren't processed yet. To process them would mean to reconstruct the connections
of the inner group. This is a problematic which the current system can't deal and which would require some rethinking.
