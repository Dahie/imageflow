Compare nodes, comparing and choosing one

Quick jobs:
- comment selection painting


Bugs:
- workflow with save-as-unit but without any displayable units is not executed, although this might be wanted


GUI:
- filter images in filechooser
- cursor keys -> move or select?
- Unit parameters window padding is not drawn correctly 


Functions:
- quicksearch of filter units in left sidepane
- Macro-Generator at For-Loops: Integer only visible in loop,
- check for bugs concerning the image retrieving after a workflow was executed (exception because of names with -1)
- setDisplay makes number units (xml_units/Math) displaying their outputs (number, double, ...), that would make the Print-unit obsolete needless


Graph:
- read all images from folder and process them


Nice-to-have:
- display help info of the units
- save unknown units from graph to directory of delegates
- zoomable graph
- labels of inputs and outputs
- insert new units not right on existing units

- list of steps to create a full graph
- disable start-workflow button for invalid workflows


V2:
- editor for unit xml
- Editing history (for nodes and properties)
- Multi-Document-Application
- new object-framework
- model-view seperation
