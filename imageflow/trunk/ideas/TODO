- add sample images to the example workflows



Quick jobs:
- comment selection painting


Bugs:
- linux: right click on unit, you get context menu, left klick in workspace, the unit is moved to this spot
- workflow with save-as-unit but without any displayable units is not executed, although this might be wanted


GUI:
- filter images in filechooser
- cursor keys -> move or select?
- improved selections: shift, strg
- Unit parameters window padding is not drawn correctly 


Functions:
- quicksearch of filter units in left sidepane
- Macro-Generator at For-Loops: Integer only visible in loop,
- check for bugs concerning the image retrieving after a workflow was executed (exception because of names with -1)


Graph:
- read all images from folder and process them
- stack-support
- MeasurementUnits -> erzeugen Tabellen, Dialoge, Histogram, Daten etc, nur keine Bilder


Nice-to-have:
- display help info of the units
- save unknown units from graph to directory of delegates
- zoomable graph
- labels of inputs and outputs
- insert new units not right on existing units

- drag and drop from delegatespanel
- list of steps to create a full graph
- disable start-workflow button for invalid workflows
- XML improvement: proper error handling


V2:
- editor for unit xml
- Editing history (for nodes and properties)
- Multi-Document-Application
- new object-framework
- model-view seperation
