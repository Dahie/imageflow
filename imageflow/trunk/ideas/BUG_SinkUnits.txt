Since Units of Type SINK do not have any outputs, 
the MacroGenerator cannot handle them correctly. 
Due to the missing output there can be problems in displaying the Units, 
which can be solved by setting the NeedToCopyInput in the xml-file to true.
Also the renaming in human readable names cannot be done by the MacroGenerator 
due to the missing outputs.

This part of the MacroGenerator (the method: addProcessingUnit(UnitElement unit) )
should be rewritten to solve the problem.
