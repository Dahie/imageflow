Loading XML-units

On the start of the program, the DelegatesController is created and searches a specified (hardcoded :/) directory.
This directory is read recursively and each subfolder and their containing XML are put into a hashmap. 
Based on this Hashmap the Menu-hierarchy is created. 

Based on each XML a UnitDescription-object is created, which contains the information to construct a unit element instance of this type.
This UnitDescription can later be passed to a UnitFactory, which creates an actual instance of this UnitElement.
The UnitDescription is stored in a UnitDelegate, which is basically a Delegate, that contains meta-information about the unit.
The delegates are listed in the insert-menu. 


The actual instance of a UnitElement is created by giving the UnitDescription to the UnitFactory, who constructs a corresponding object.
