Quick jobs:
- comment selection painting

Bugs:


GUI:
- sidepane resize
- filter images in filechooser
- cursor keys -> move or select?
- more keyshortcuts?

Functions:
- as imageJ plugin / standalone
- macro optimierung, cleanup, no duplicates?
- no other jars (jdom) -> buildscript

Graph:
- optional Node-Alignment
- ordner image source
- stack-support


Nice-to-have:
- display help info of the units
- save unknown units from graph to directory of delegates
- zoomable graph
- labels of inputs and outputs
- insert new units not right on existing units

- drag and drop from delegatespanel
- list of steps to create a full graph
- disable start-workflow button for invalid workflows
- XML improvement: proper error handling



V2:
- editor for unit xml
- Editing history (for nodes and properties)
- Grouping of units
- Multi-Document-Application
- no more visualap? -> new object-framework
- model-view seperation
