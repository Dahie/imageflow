Functions:
- as imageJ plugin / standalone
- no other jars (jdom) -> buildscript

Graph:
- fixed loop detection
- optional Node-Alignment
- ordner image source aka stack-support


Nice-to-have:
- display help info of the units
- save unknown units from graph to directory of delegates
- cleanup of the graph
- zoomable graph
- labels of inputs and outputs
- insert new units not right on existing units
- editor for unit xml
- drag and drop from delegatespanel

V2:
- Editing history (for nodes and properties)
- Grouping of units
- Multi-Document-Application
- no more visualapp?



Known problems:
- fixed imagebitdepth test during connection: the image bitdepth is not known during build time, only in macro runtime
