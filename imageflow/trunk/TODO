GUI:
- Insert-Panel, that displays all possible nodes, from which a node can be dragged on the workflow


Functions:
- Save workflows
- as imageJ plugin / standalone
- no other jars (jdom)

Graph:
- fixed imagebizdepth test during connection
- fixed loop detection
- optional Node-Alignment


Nice-to-have:
- display help info of the units
- Automatic load of new plugins
- have a nice info text on the empty panel
- cleanup of the graph
- zoomable graph
- labels of inputs and outputs

V2:
- Editing history (for nodes and properties)
- Grouping of units
- Multi-Document-Application
- no more visualapp?
