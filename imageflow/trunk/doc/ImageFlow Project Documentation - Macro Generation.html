<h1>Imageflow Project Documentation</h1>
<h2>Macro Generation</h2>
<p>We have a workflow constructed in our workspace and we execute it. 
In short, the workflow is checked, if it's valid, the units are sorted 
and ImageJ Macro Code is generated and handed over to ImageJ.
ImageJ then performs the actual processing, while ImageFlow never touches any
Image data. Read here in more details how this Macro Code is generated. </p>

<h3>Start workflow task</h3>
<p>The application starts a new <code><a href="https://appframework.dev.java.net/nonav/javadoc/AppFramework-1.03/org/jdesktop/application/Task.html" title="Task API">Task</a></code>, 
which creates a new Thread that performs the execution. To read more about 
Tasks consult the pages about the used 
<a href="ImageFlow%20Project%20Documentation%20-%20Appframework.html" title="Appframework in ImageFlow">Appframework</a>.

<h3>Create Macro Code</h3>

<p>The Task contains the current GraphController, which has a method to start 
generating Macro-code based on it's contents. 
The GraphController has a <code>generateMacro()</code>-method, which is 
called by the Task. This method creates a 
new <code>FlowRunner</code-object.</p>

<h3>MacroFlowRunner</h3>

<p>The <code>MacroFlowRunner</code> receives a clone of the list of all units 
contained in a workflow.
Before processing we check the unitList for different common errors, which 
check the validity of the workflow. This tests if all required inputs 
are connected, if all datatypes are valid and the connections ok.</p>  

 
<p>The second purpose of the class is to clean and sort all 
units in the workflow. Unnecessary units are are dismissed and
the units are resorted in the order required to be performed later. Since 
certain units require the input of other units, they need
to be processed later. Solving these dependencies is done by a special 
algorithm.</p>

<p>This algorithm cleans and resorts the list of units. 
It gets the cloned list of units and creates a second temporary list.  
If this condition is true, the units is moved from the first list to the 
second list and it's outputs are marked as processed.
When a unit is checked, the algorithm tests the connected inputs and 
checks if these marks are set for all of them. 
If this condition is true, the unit is moved again and we take a look 
at the next unit. The algorithm performs as long as units 
exist in the first list.</p>

<p>There are more than the above condition to move units.</p>
<ul>
<li>The usual condition is, as described above to check all inputs 
and whether they are fulfilled.</li>
<li>Comments-Nodes are removed completely.</li>
<li>Source-Units don't have inputs, so they are moved as long as 
they are set to display.</li>
</ul>
<p>for each unit the algorithm checks, if this branch of the workflow needs to be translated to Macro Code at all.
You can create a branch in the your workspace, which is dormant, 
as long as no unit in this branch is set to display.</p>

<p>The <code>MacroFlowRunner</code> returns a list of Units. 
which is in the right order and where all invalid or unused Units are removed.
This list is passed to the <code>MacroGenerator</code>.

<h3>Macro Generator</h3>

<p>The <code>MacroGenerator</code> translates the ordered list of Units 
and list of connections into Macro Code which is performed by ImageJ. 
The class iterates over all units and creates the Macro Code based on the 
properties of the unit. </p>

<p>The generated Macro Code can explained rather easy. The first line sets the 
macro execution to batch mode, which means, that it runs in the background
without displaying any temporary results.</p>
<pre><code>setBatchMode(true); </code></pre>

<p>Nun kommt der Hauptteil des Macros, in dem nacheinander die Units 
blöckeweise dem Macro angehängt werden.</p>

<pre><code>open("/home/user/pics/image.png");
rename("Unit_1_Output_1_0"); 
ID_Unit_1_Output_1_0 = getImageID(); 
selectImage(ID_Unit_1_Output_1_0); </code></pre>

<p>This shows the open command. The opening the image creates a new image, 
which is renamed to be uniquely identifiable by succeeding units. </p>

<pre><code>// Gaussian Blur
 
selectImage(ID_Unit_1_Output_1_0); 
run("Duplicate...", "title=Title_Temp_ID_Unit_1_Output_1_0"); 
run("Gaussian Blur...", "sigma=4.0 ");
rename("Unit_2_Output_1_0"); 
ID_Unit_2_Output_1_0 = getImageID(); 
selectImage(ID_Unit_2_Output_1_0);</code></pre> 

<p>This shows a processing unit, which takes the image from the open-unit
and performs a Gaussian Blur on it. Since we don't want to change the 
original Output-Image, we clone this output, before we apply the filter.
The result is renamed again and can now be access by succeeding units.</p>

<p>At this point, for every unit the <code>MacroElement</code>-String 
is parsed. This is the command that contains the command ImageJ is
supposed to call. This command contains a number of wildcards, 
which are replaced at this point. More about this in the 
<a href="Unit%20XML%20Documentation.html" title="XML Specification">XML-specification</a>.</p>
<p>Once, all units are done, we do some post-cleaning on the macro. 
All temporary and unused images are closed. Only images for units, that are set
display remain at the end and are renamed with a human-readable name.</p>

<h3>ImageJ</h3>

<p>The generated Macro is stored in a String. This is 
passed to an ImageJ instance.</p>

<pre><code>
String macro = ...
Macro_Runner mr = new Macro_Runner();
return mr.runMacro(macro, "");</code></pre>

<p>A ImageJ GUI pops up, the macro is performed and displays the desired images.</p>
<p>Imageflow tries to catch as many errors in the workflow as possible, however there are limits.
Possible incompatibilities or problems will occure here and ImageJ will give out his
error messages.</p>

<p>The workflow either processed successfully or failed at some point. This Exceptions are caught and
the programm can continously used without restart.</p>
