<h2>Appframework</h2>
<p>To understand how the application is working, it is important to understand what the Appframework is doing.</p>
<h3>General</h3>
<p>During the production of every application comes a point where the programmer is faced with the same general problems. 
How to handle resources and localization? How to handle threads? How to deal with actions and threads? 
What is the basic data structure, Model-View-Controller? <br />
Most programmers develop their own solutions over time and reuse them in their programs. The disadvantages are, 
that for common problems, many different solutions were implemented and everybody cooked by their own recipy. Secondly, 
these solutions contain only the experience of one programmer and the problems he faced before. Anticipating problems 
is naturally difficult. </p>
<p>For this reason, I didn't want to base this application on my earlier programs, but instead on a general purpose
desktop application framework. This framework was supposed to give a skeleton 
for the model-controller structure, resource management, thread handling 
and action-handling. <a href="https://appframework.dev.java.net" title="Appframework Website">
Appframework</a> developed as <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=296" title="Spezifikation">
Specification JSR-296</a> 
by Sun. The framework was specified in 2006 and has been in development since then. 
It was scheduled to be included in Java7 and by 2008 it was already included NetBeans.</p>
