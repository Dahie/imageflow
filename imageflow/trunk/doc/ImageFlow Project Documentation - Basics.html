<title>ImageFlow Project Documentation - Basics</title></head><body>
<h1>Imageflow Project Documentation</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>ImageFlow
started out as the&nbsp;Project for the Bachelor-Thesis by Daniel
Senff. The development was continued during an internship at CRP Henri
Tudor in Luxemburg. The program is open source and can modified to
suite their own needs or be taken as a base for own applications.&nbsp;
In the 10 months of development the application grew in complexity.
It's still a small project which can be handled easily by 1-2
developers, however this documentation should help to easily get into
the technical solutions applied here.</p>
<h2>Task</h2><p>The task of the
application is to create a graphical user interface for the creation of
ImageJ-macro using an node-based solution. The user should be able to
create image-processing solution just by connecting processing units on
a workspace. The constructed graph would be transformed to a
one-dimensional Macro-Code and passed to ImageJ, which would do the
actual image processing. The application was build around this basic
dilemma.</p>
<h2>History</h2><p>The project began around October 2008 with
the beginning of the Bachelor-Thesis of Daniel Senff. His mentor for
the thesis was <a href="http://www.f4.htw-berlin.de/~barthel/" title="Website of Prof. Barthel">Prof. Kai-Uwe Barthel</a> 
who published in accordance with
Daniel a paper for the ImageJ conference about the basic intention of
the program. Based on a rough early prototype describing the basic
structure of the graph and the conversion from this virtual graph to an
executable ImageJ Macro.</p>
<p>Based on this prototype Daniel developed
ImageFlow as his project for the Bachelor-Thesis and released the first
beta in March 2009 and the Bachelor-Thesis in April 2009.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interested
by the conference paper describing the application, the 
<a href="http://www.tudor.lu" title="CRP Tudor Luxembourg">CRP Henri Tudor</a>
invited him to continue the development for another 4 months. In
Luxembourg Daniel was joined by a colleague of his, 
<a href="http://www.friedrichmaiwald.de/" title="Website of Friedrich Maiwald"Friedrich Maiwald</a>. 
In May 2009 the first stable version was released. </p>
<h2>Components</h2>
<p>To fulfill the tasks. The program is originally based 
on three major components.</p>
<p>Obviously
the most important basis was ImageJ, which would deal with the actual
image processing. The basis for the graphical workflow was VisualAp,
however over the course of the project it's influence decreased and
many functions were implemented separately. The third component is the
Swing AppFramework, which gives a skeleton for the basic application
structure.</p>
<h3>ImageJ</h3>
<p>ImageJ is an open source application for image analyzing.
Through it's rich plugin-interface and a well-documented api it was a
great basis for image-editing in Java. ImageJ has its own scripting
language to perform batch tasks. These macros can be saved and
integrated into the program structure.</p><p>Macros can be
created by two ways. Either by hand or using the limited
Macro-Recorder. Imageflow was to provide a visual user interface for
creating Macros.</p>
<h3>VisualAp</h3><p>Since the graph-interaction can be
quite complex to develop from scratch it was seen to find a basis.
After trying several Java-based Open-Source Frameworks for
flow-processing and node-based interaction it was decided to build upon
<a href="https://visualap.dev.java.net/" title="VisualAp Website">VisualAp</a>.</p>
<p>VisualAp already included a lot of the functionality
intended for the final application of ImageFlow. It brought the
Components to draw a workspace, including the graph with units and
their connections. These elements could be moved, copied, pasted,
duplicated and reconnected. There was a clipboard and VisualAp
delivered many of the basic graph.</p> 
<p>However, there were a few major differences. VisualAp's unit-management 
was based around JavaBeans. Jar-files containing the processing units. 
This management was not used,
but instead an own specification of defining XML-units to generate 
processing-units was developed.</p>
<h3>Appframework</h3>
<p>One of the early decisions was to base the application around a 
Desktop Application Framework. This framework was supposed to give a skeleton 
for the model-controller structure, resource management, thread handling 
and action-handling. <a href="https://appframework.dev.java.net" title="Appframework Website">
Appframework</a> developed as <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=296" title="Spezifikation">
Specification JSR-296</a> 
by Sun. The framework was specified in 2006 and has been in development since then. 
It was scheduled to be included in Java7 and by 2008 it was already included NetBeans.</p>
