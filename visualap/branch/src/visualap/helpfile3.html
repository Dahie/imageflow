<H2>Introduction</H2>
A component (or proclet) is the building block of the VisualAp
environment.
A component is shown with its icon plus a number of terminals. 

Terminals
are represented by a small blue square. Terminals are also called
pins.
Input
terminals are placed in the left side of a component, while output
terminals are placed in the right side of a component.
<H2>Using components</H2>
It is
possible to view/modify the configuration of a component by
double-click over a component in the workplace panel.
Components
can be connected together by first pressing the mouse button over a
terminal, then move the mouse pointer over another terminal and then
release the mouse button: an edge between the two terminals is
created. <BR><BR>

The
following rules must be followed when connecting a terminal to
another one:
<UL>
	<LI>it is
	not possible to connect together two or more output terminals
	<LI>any
	input terminal must be connected to an output terminal
	<LI>loops
	and cycles are not allowed in a system
</UL>
These
errors are detected only when the system is checked (System-&gt;Check) or run (System-&gt;Run)
<BR>

It is
possible to design and release new components for VisualAp. please
read the related developer guide.<BR><BR>

New
components shall be placed in the &lt;beans&gt; directory under the
VisualAp installation directory.
