<H1>VisualAp</H1>
<H2>Introduction</H2>
VisualAp is a visual framework for building application and systems based on lightweight visual components, called proclets. 
Users can add their own components in order to extend the capability of VisualAp.
<br>
The VisualAp application can be used to perform audio processing, image processing, text and other process-driven emulation.

<BR>

The user
can create an application by selecting the components from a toolbox,
configuring the parameters (via the Javabeans framework), and
connecting the components together in order to set-up communication
channels between the components.
<BR>

In the
first release the user runs code execution through the engine
included in VisualAp, in interpreted mode. In later releases it will
be possible to generate Java code that can be compiled and run in
standalone mode.
<H2>Basic Concepts</H2>
VisualAp
is based on two main concepts: system and components.
A
component is the basic element providing some services. A system is
build using a number of components that are configured and connected
together in order to achieve a complex functionality.
<br>
A system is a graph whose nodes are the components.
Note that in VisualAp a component is also called proclet (processing element). 


<BR>

There are
three type of components:
<UL>
	<LI>source:
	any component that generates some sort of data
	<LI>sink:
	any component that consumes data
	<LI>processor:
	any component that process input data into output data
</UL>
